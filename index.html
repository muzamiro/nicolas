<p>Only five kilometres from the east coast of peninsular Malaysia, Gemia Island is easy to miss on a map. It is a tiny, rocky island covered in lush tropical greenery and fringed by curves of pure white sand. While this small gem may easily be overlooked, it will not be easily forgotten. 
  
  Gemia Island is only a few hundred metres from the better known Kapas Island, but offers a completely different experience. There is only one resort on Gemia, guaranteeing that you will have the beach coves and the aquamarine water almost to yourself. 
  
  Most of the rooms are built on stilts over the water and offer a superior level of comfort and spaciousness. The balconies are carefully constructed to ensure complete privacy, so you can enjoy the tranquillity of the view undisturbed. 
  
  One of the other attractions of Gemia Island is the Spa. To round off your tropical island experience and to ensure that you go home relaxed and rejuvenated, do indulge in one of their treatments.</p>

<p>Apart from treating yourself and lazing in the sunshine there are various ways to keep busy during your stay on Gemia Island. Enjoying the crystal clear water and the abundance of marine life here is a must. Most visitors will go snorkelling or scuba diving to get a closer view of the colourful corals, while others will rent a sea kayak and paddle around the island. There are many other ways to make the most of your Gemia Island holiday and you can read more about it here.

Gemia Island may be small but there is no compromise on comfort. A holiday here will leave you reminiscing about your days in paradise for a long time. </p>
